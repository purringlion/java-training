This is a warmup exercise.

## 1. Create multiple calculator objects
In the calculator demo application:
- create an array to hold multiple calculator objects
- create calculator objects and store in the array
- add 10 random numbers to each calculator
- loop and print the value of each calculator

## 2. Think about how your application uses memory
- Which objects are on the heap?
- What does the array contain?
- What is stored on the stack?
